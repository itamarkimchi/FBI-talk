  abstract    = "For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal
                 fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations
                 prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a
                 macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a
                 many-body system when the relative strength of two competing
                 energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we
                 observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein
                 condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a
                 three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential
                 depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed
                 from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid
                 phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with
                 long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact
                 numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites,
                 with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is
                 characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can
                 induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the
                 system.",

                   dimensional hierarchy",
  author        = "Ryu, Shinsei and Schnyder, Andreas and Furusaki, Akira and
                   Ludwig, Andreas",
  abstract      = "It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension
                   there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological
                   insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the
                   different topological sectors can be distinguished,
                   depending on the case, by a Z or a Z\_2 topological
                   invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we
                   construct representatives of topological insulators and
                   superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary
                   spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using
                   these representatives we demonstrate how topological
                   insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and
                   different classes can be related via dimensional reduction
                   by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in
                   Kaluza-Klein-like fashion). For Z-topological insulators
                   (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one
                   dimension at a time into a different class. The
                   Z\_2-topological insulators (superconductors), on the other
                   hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of
                   parent Z-topological insulators in the same class, from
                   which they inherit their topological properties. The 8-fold
                   periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological
                   insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at
                   least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or
                   charge-conjugation/particle-hole symmetries) is a reflection
                   of the 8-fold periodicity of the spinor representations of
                   the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). We
                   derive a relation between the topological invariant that
                   characterizes topological insulators/superconductors with
                   chiral symmetry and the Chern-Simons invariant: it relates
                   the invariant to the electric polarization (d=1), or to the
                   magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3). Finally, we discuss
                   topological field theories describing the space time theory
                   of linear responses, and study how the presence of inversion
                   symmetry modifies the classification.",

                   insulators which manifest edge states on a lattice with
                   spatial boundaries. In the physical energy spectrum, a
                   subset of the edge states that intersect the Fermi level
                   translates to discontinuities in the trace of the
                   single-particle entanglement spectrum, which we call a
                   `trace index'. We find that any free-fermion topological
                   insulator that exhibits spectral flow has a non-vanishing
                   trace index, which provides us with a new description of
                   topological invariants. In addition, we identify the
                   signatures of spectral flow in the single-particle and
                   many-body entanglement spectrum; in the process we present
