\item[] For the honeycomb featureless boson insulator:
\item Entanglement spectrum reveals a gapless free boson edge
\item Edge spectrum points with nonzero charge or nonzero momentum are degenerate
\item This degeneracy is protected by combined inversion and charge parity
\item[]
\item Cannot be deformed to trivial state while the bosons are not allowed to live at the hexagon centers
\item The representation of the lattice and charge symmetry (size of unit cell and charge per unit cell) matters for classifying featureless insulators
