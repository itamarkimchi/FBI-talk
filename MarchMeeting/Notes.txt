Notes

Hello, I'm Brayden and I'm going to be talking about the entanglement properties of featureless Mott insulators.

This is joint work with Itamar from UC Berkeley, Sid from UC Irvine, and Bela from Station Q.

A quantum Hamiltonian is 'featureless' if it has exactly one low-energy bulk state, the ground state. 'Features' would include the degenerate ground states that occur under spontaneous symmetry breaking, gapless modes, or topologically degenerate states. Featureless doesn't mean boring - features are still allowed on the edge, or in nonlocal bulk properties like the entanglement spectrum. 'Insulators' of course refers to a U(1) charge symmetry, so in this talk we will be discussing quantum ground states on lattices that preserve charge and lattice symmetries. 

Arguments by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1D and later extended by others to higher dimensions show that featureless insulators are forbidden for systems with a fractional charge per unit cell - a low-energy state can always be constructed. One motivation for this line of work is to discover whether there are additional constraints to making featureless insulators -  is there a featureless insulator at every integer value of charge per unit cell. Indeed, additional contraints were found for nonsymmorphic lattices, for which I'll refer you to Sid's paper. What they also acheived is a construction of featureless insulators in all the other cases, so they completed the business of extended the Lieb Schultz Mattis theorem.
Today I'm going to be telling you about a featureless insulator on the honeycomb lattice that came from this construction.

# An example of an additional constraint on featureless insulators, in the case of free fermions, goes by the name of symmetry protected band touching. On the honeycomb lattice, the D6 # point group forbids a free fermion featureless insulator with filling 1. (is time-reversal needed here??)
