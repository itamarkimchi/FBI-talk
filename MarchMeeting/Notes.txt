Notes

Hello, I'm Brayden and I'm going to be talking about the entanglement properties of featureless Mott insulators.

This is joint work with Sid from UC Irvine, Itamar from UC Berkeley, and Bela from Station Q.

From the point of view of this talk, 'featureless' refers to the absence of multiple low-energy bulk states of a quantum Hamiltonian, such as the degenerate ground states that occur under spontaneous symmetry breaking, gapless modes, or topologically degenerate states. 'Insulators' of course refers to a U(1) charge symmetry, so in this talk we will be discussing quantum ground states that preserve U(1) charge symmetry and crystalline lattice symmetries.

Arguments by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis in 1D and later extended by others to higher dimensions show that featureless insulators are forbidden for systems with a fractional charge per unit cell - a low-energy state can always be constructed. One motivation for this line of work is to discover whether there are additional constraints to making featureless insulators.

Despite having no bulk features, featureless insulators can still have robust edge features. Today I'm going to be telling you about a featureless insulator on the honeycomb lattice with a robust edge. The edge is protected by the U(1) charge and honeycomb lattice symmetries - no additional symmetries such as time reversal are required.

? An example of an additional constraint on featureless insulators, in the case of free fermions, goes by the name of symmetry protected band touching. On the honeycomb lattice, the D6 point group forbids a free fermion featureless insulator with filling 1. (is time-reversal needed here??)
