\item These edge symmetries $V_g$ commute with the 'reduced density matrix' $\tilde{\rho}_L$ of the system and thus only act non-trivially on degenerate entanglement spectra eigenvalues. 

\item Because the classes of projective symmetry groups are discrete, you can't change the action on the edge continuously between classes (without going through a phase transition.)
