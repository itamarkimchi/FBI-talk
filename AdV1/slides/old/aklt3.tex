\item Transfer matrix is simple (one eigenvalue of magnitude $1$).
\item Correlations decay with power $-\frac{1}{3}$
\item Reduced density matrix has eigenvalues $\frac12, \frac12$
\item Can't continuously tune to a product state without breaking SU(2) symmetry
\item Two Schmidt states look like infinite system ground state far from boundary
\item Schmidt states differ by a spin 1/2 degree of freedom living near boundary
\item Degeneracy 2 on half-infinite chain, 1 on circle
\item Advanced result: Can't continuously tune to a product state without breaking $D_2$ AND time-reversal AND spatial reflection symmetry
