\vskip-1.5cm
A wavefunction written as a product of local operators acting on a product state can simply be turned into a tensor network.


\note{Computations done by putting state on cylinder and using infinite-MPS techniques. Limited to circumference 10 cylinders by construction of transfer matrix.}
