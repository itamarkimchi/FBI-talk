\begin{frame}{Existence of Featureless Insulators}
\vskip -1.5cm
Given a (non-Bravais) lattice and an integer particle number per unit cell, is there always a featureless insulator?

\note{If yes, can we distinguish different featureless insulators?}

Naive constructions don't work on the honeycomb lattice because you can't pick a symmetric unit cell. For fermion band insulators, filling orbitals in a non-symmetric unit cell can still lead to symmetric wave functions to the antisymmetrization of fermions.
