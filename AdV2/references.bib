  abstract    = "For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal
                 fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations
                 prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a
                 macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a
                 many-body system when the relative strength of two competing
                 energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we
                 observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose-Einstein
                 condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a
                 three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential
                 depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed
                 from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid
                 phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with
                 long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact
                 numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites,
                 with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is
                 characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can
                 induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the
                 system.",

  abstract      = "It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension
                   there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological
                   insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the
                   different topological sectors can be distinguished,
                   depending on the case, by a Z or a Z\_2 topological
                   invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we
                   construct representatives of topological insulators and
                   superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary
                   spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using
                   these representatives we demonstrate how topological
                   insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and
                   different classes can be related via dimensional reduction
                   by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in
                   Kaluza-Klein-like fashion). For Z-topological insulators
                   (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one
                   dimension at a time into a different class. The
                   Z\_2-topological insulators (superconductors), on the other
                   hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of
                   parent Z-topological insulators in the same class, from
                   which they inherit their topological properties. The 8-fold
                   periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological
                   insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at
                   least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or
                   charge-conjugation/particle-hole symmetries) is a reflection
                   of the 8-fold periodicity of the spinor representations of
                   the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). We
                   derive a relation between the topological invariant that
                   characterizes topological insulators/superconductors with
                   chiral symmetry and the Chern-Simons invariant: it relates
                   the invariant to the electric polarization (d=1), or to the
                   magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3). Finally, we discuss
                   topological field theories describing the space time theory
                   of linear responses, and study how the presence of inversion
                   symmetry modifies the classification.",

                   translates to discontinuities in the trace of the

                   insulator that exhibits spectral flow has a non-vanishing
                   trace index, which provides us with a new description of

                   distinguished by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Implicit
                   here is the assumption that a completely symmetric state
                   exists: a paramagnet. At zero temperature such quantum
                   featureless insulators may be forbidden, triggering either
                   conventional order or topological order with fractionalized
                   excitations. Such is the case for interacting particles when
                   the particle number per unit cell, f, is not an integer.
                   But, can lattice symmetries forbid featureless insulators
                   even at integer f? An especially relevant case is the
                   honeycomb (graphene) lattice --- where free spinless
                   fermions at f=1 (the two sites per unit cell mean f=1 is
                   half filling per site) are always metallic. Here we present
                   wave functions for bosons, and a related spin-singlet wave
                   function for spinful electrons, on the f=1 honeycomb, and
                   demonstrate via quantum to classical mappings that they do
                   form featureless Mott insulators. The construction
                   generalizes to symmorphic lattices at integer f in any
                   dimension. Our results explicitly demonstrate that in this
                   case, despite the absence of a non-interacting insulator at
                   the same filling, lack of order at zero temperature does not
                   imply fractionalization.",
