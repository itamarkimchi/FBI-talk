MPS for featureless 1D or quasi-1D systems have non-degenerate transfer matrices and are called simple. Simple MPS can be proved to have:

\bi 
\item Correlations are insensitive to boundary conditions
\item Can construct a featureless 'parent Hamiltonian' 
\note{from the wavefunction alone}
\item Two simple MPS with equal wavefunctions are (uniquely) gauge equivalent
\item Corollary: Edges can be labeled with a (possibly projective) representation of the group of physical symmetries.

\item Bonus: we can determine $V_g$ by diagonalizing the transfer matrix with the insertion $U_g$.

\item 
\item Correlations in spontaneous symmetry breaking MPS have extreme senstivity to boundary conditions
\item Correlations in topological ordered state (on large enough cylinder) completely insensitive to boundary conditions when operators don't wrap around cylinder.
\item Gapless 2D PEPS on cylinder?
