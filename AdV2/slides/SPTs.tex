Entanglement measures the obstruction from writing a single wavefunction as an atomic insulator. Protected entanglement is entanglement that can't be removed by adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian.

\begin{block}{SPT phase}
 A phase of matter that cannot be connected adiabatically to an atomic insulator, using $G$-symmetric Hamiltonians, is called a {\em symmetry protected topological} or SPT phase.
\end{block}

\bi
\item No symmetry group needed, then topological ordered - not SPT.
\item Featureless but feature featured edges.
\bi 
\item Physical or entanglement edge, when cut respects $G$
\item Look for these patterns in entanglement spectra!
