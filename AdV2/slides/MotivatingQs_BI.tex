%We want to classify and understand all featureless insulators, 
%but thats a big undertaking so lets break that question down into some not necessarily independent smaller questions.

Fix a lattice $\Lambda$, symmetry group $G$, and integer filling number $m$

\begin{block}{Existence}
Are there \textbf{constraints} on the existence of featureless insulators?

Can you \textbf{construct} reference featureless insulators?

\bi
\item<2> Constraints given by symmetry protected band touchings 
\ei
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Uniqueness}
Can we \textbf{characterize} the properties that make a given wavefunction distinct from the trivial phase?

Can we \textbf{enumerate} all possible phases of featureless insulators (up to adiabatic changes in Hamiltonian that respect $G$)?

%This is the formal definition of symmetry protected topological phase. 
%There are general, mathematical principles for generating a list of classes, but besides in 1d its not provably complete.

%A wavefunction can be protected by more than one symmetry group.
