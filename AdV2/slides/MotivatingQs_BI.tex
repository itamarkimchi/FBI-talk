\begin{block}{Existence}
Are there \textbf{constraints} on the existence of featureless insulators?
Can we \textbf{construct} featureless insulators when possible?
\\\vspace{1em}
{\em
Given a %particularly non-bravais 
lattice $\Lambda$, and an integer $m$, is there a featureless insulating phase of matter with $m$ particles per unit cell? 

%Our goal is to show exactly when you can construct a featureless state for every $m$ and $\Lambda$ - any additional constraints would be an extension of the LSM theorem.
}
%The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem gives one such constraint - m must be an integer. But

\begin{block}{Uniqueness}
How can we \textbf{distinguish} different classes of featureless insulators?
%Numerically, experimentally, etc.

Can we \textbf{enumerate} all such classes?\\
%Is there a general, mathematical principle for classifying featureless insulators?
