To make a precise comparison with the free-boson CFT, we'll need to solve for (or look up) the solution of this model.

The free-boson CFT is created from the Lagrangian 
$$ \mathfrak{L} = \frac{g}{2}\int dt \int\limits_0^L dx ( \frac{1}{v^2}(\partial_t \phi)^2 - (\partial_x \phi)^2)$$
and with the compatified field identification
$$ \phi \equiv \phi + 2\pi R$$
and placed on the circle of circumference $L$ with periodic boundary conditions
$$ \phi(x) \equiv \phi(x+L).$$
