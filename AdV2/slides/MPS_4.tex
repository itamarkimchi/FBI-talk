Recall that the boundary conditions in a MPS are set by a matrix at the edge.

Inserting the group operation $V_g$ on a single link in a periodic chain is the same as changing the boundary conditions. This is an operational procedure for 'threading a flux' that works in interacting theories or even with then symmetry is inversion or time-reversal.

The edge action can be interpreted as a 'composition of fluxes' $V_g V_h = \exp{i \omega(g, h)} V_{gh}$.
