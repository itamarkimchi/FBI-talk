%We want to classify and understand all featureless insulators, 
%but thats a big undertaking so lets break that question down into some smaller questions.


\begin{block}{Existence}
Fix a lattice $\Lambda$, symmetry group $G$, and integer filling number $m$

Do there exist any featureless insulators at all?
\bi 
\item Find \textbf{obstruction} to existence
\item or \textbf{construct} a reference featureless insulator
\ei 
%The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem gives one such constraint - m must be an integer. Is that the only constraint? Can you prove it by constructing featureless insulators for every m? You might try to construct one and realize that there are additional obstructions that you haven't thought of yet, which would allow you to extend the LSM theorem.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Characterization}
Given a quantum wavefunction, is it a featureless insulator? Is it distinguishable from atomic insulator in the presence of a symmetry group $G$? What is $G$?

\bi
\item Show non-trivial protected physical or entanglement edge modes 
\item Find a topological invariant that distinguishes it
\ei 
\end{block}
