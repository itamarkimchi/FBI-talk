\begin{frame}{Open questions and speculation}
\bi
\item Parent Hamiltonian - Construct or obstruction?
\item Symmetry group/groups that protect edge?
\item Correspondence between bulk perturbations and edge perturbations?
\item Nearby phase transitions? 
\item Is the edge `anomalous'? 
\item We can put lots of known SPTs in tensor networks. What should we do next?
\item Can we represent transfer matrix as a MPO for efficient contraction?
\item Tensor Network RG?
