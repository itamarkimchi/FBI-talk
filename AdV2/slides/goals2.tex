\begin{block}{Completed}
\bi 
\item Build a tensor network representation for doing computations
\item  Verify that no spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs
%We'll do this by computing correlation functions on a cylinder geometry combined with scaling analysis in the circumference

\item Rule out topological order

\item Compute entanglement spectrum to check for nontrivial entanglement

\bi
\item Understand the role of symmetries in protecting entanglement in interacting quasi-1D and 2D theories
\item Find distinguishing topological invariant and/or physical signatures
\item Find a parent Hamiltonian
