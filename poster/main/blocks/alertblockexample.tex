\begin{alertblock}{An ``Alert'' Block}
The ``alert'' block environment looks like this. It also has justified text, but it has a border and a light background to make it stand out. You can create one like so:
\begin{semiverbatim}
{\color{red}\\begin}\{{\color{blue}alertblock}\}\{Title\}\newline
\hskip1ex.......\newline
{\color{red}\\end}\{{\color{blue}alertblock}\}
\end{semiverbatim}
\end{alertblock}
