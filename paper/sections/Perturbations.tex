\section{Quasi-local parent Hamiltonian and perturbations}

\label{sec:perturbations}

This could be achieved for example by adding a staggered field 
$$
H' = h \sum\limits_{i} (-1)^i \left(b_i + b_i^{\dagger}\right),
$$
where the coefficients $(-1)^i$ takes opposite values on the two sublattices, 
to a Hamiltonian for the state. More complicated staggering fields that break translational 
symmetry but change sign under inversion can be also be used - additionally, the symmetry $\I_y$ 
can be used in place of $\I$ which protects against different sets of patterns of staggering the 
field.
