\section{F.B.I. wavefunction}

It was argued by Kimchi, et. al. \cite{Kimchi2012-lr} that this state represents a featureless Mott insulating phase of bosons on the honeycomb lattice.

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \prod\limits_{R} \sum\limits_{i \in R} b^{\dagger}_{i} \ket{0}
\label{eq:def}
\end{equation}
