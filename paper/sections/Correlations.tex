\section{Correlation functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Show correlation bounds for soft-core and hard-core states, correlation function fits.
\item Emphasize that $\xi < L$ for the attainable system sizes $L$, so that we can have some trust in our results.
\item Show that correlations are isotropic.
\item Show that everything agrees with MC results, as far as those are available.
\end{itemize}
