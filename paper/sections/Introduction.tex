Featureless insulator problem description from   \onlinecite{parameswaran2013}
\bi 
\item Classical Mott insulators have integer site filling
\item LSM forbids featureless insulators at fractional unit cell 
filling. Site-filling can still be multiples of $1/n$
\item Extensions to LSM in \onlinecite{parameswaran2013-2} further 
forbid some site fractional site fillings for non-symmorphic lattices.

The simplest example of a tensor network for a 1D system is a matrix 
product state; translationally-invariant matrix product states (MPS) 
are represented by a single rank 3 tensor $A_p^{ij}$ which specifies 
the wavefunction coefficients in a given basis local basis as a 
product of matrices $$\ket{\psi} = \sum\limits_{\{p_i\}} A_{p_1} 
A_{p_2} ... A_{p_N} \ket{p_0 p_1 ... p_N},$$ with one matrix for each 
site in the one-dimensional system.

PEPS are the generalization of MPS to two and higher dimensions, where 
each site in the system is represented by a rank $z+1$ tensor, where 
$z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, and wavefunction 
coefficients are similarly given by contracting over all virtual 
indices as shown in Figure \ref{fig:PEPS}.\cite{verstraete2004}
