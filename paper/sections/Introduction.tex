\section{Introduction}

\bela{This is pretty clich\'{e} right now. It's also missing all references.}

Recent years have seen the proliferation of phases that defy a description
within the well-known framework of local order parameters. These phases are
not characterized by a local order parameter, but rather by more subtle,
non-local features. An important class of such phases are topological phases,
with key characteristics such as exotic, anyonic excitations. Another
important class are symmetry-protected topological phases, which have
garnered a great deal of attention since their original discovery.

Famously, the Lieb-Schults-Mattis (LSM) theorem and its extensions gives a set of
conditions under which such an exotic phase not only can, but indeed \emph{must}
exist. In particular, they forbid the existence of a featureless state
-- a state that neither spontaneously breaks a symmetry, nor displays topological
order, nor has power-law correlations and is thus ''gapless'' -- in systems
with a fractional filling per unit cell. Extensions to LSM in \onlinecite{parameswaran2013-2} further
forbid some site fractional site fillings for non-symmorphic lattices.

In Ref.~\onlinecite{kimchi2013}, an interesting special case was considered,
namely that of half-filled bosons on the honeycomb lattice. In this case, where
there is one boson per unit cell of two sites, the LSM allows the existence
of a featureless state. At the same time, however, symmetry guarantees that
a free-fermion spectrum is gapless at certain high-symmetry points and there is
thus no localized Wannier basis. This implies that
a featureless state cannot be constructed by filling a permanent
of localized Wannier orbitals, and any construction must thus involve interactions
in a non-trivial way. The explicit construction of Ref.~\onlinecite{kimchi2013},
henceforth dubbed honeycomb featureless boson insulator (HFBI),
will be discussed in detail in Section~\ref{sec:fbi}.
\bela{Possibly move the first few paragraphs of Sec II, or at least a short summary, here?}

The main focus of this paper will be on the edge properties of the HFBI.
In particular, we will find that while the state is featureless in the bulk, it
features a gapless edge state which is protected by a combination of lattice inversion
and spin symmetry. We will argue for this by calculating the entanglement spectrum,
which we achieve using recently developed tensor network methods.

The simplest example of a tensor network for a 1D system is a matrix
product state; translationally-invariant matrix product states (MPS)
are represented by a single rank 3 tensor $A_p^{ij}$ which specifies
the wavefunction coefficients in a given basis local basis as a
product of matrices $$\ket{\psi} = \sum\limits_{\{p_i\}} A_{p_1}
A_{p_2} ... A_{p_N} \ket{p_0 p_1 ... p_N},$$ with one matrix for each
site in the one-dimensional system.

PEPS are the generalization of MPS to two and higher dimensions, where
each site in the system is represented by a rank $z+1$ tensor, where
$z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, and wavefunction
coefficients are similarly given by contracting over all virtual
indices as shown in Figure \ref{fig:PEPS}.\cite{verstraete2004}
