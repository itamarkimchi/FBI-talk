\begin{abstract}
While the Lieb-Schultz-Matthis theorem allows the existence of a fully
symmetric bosonic paramagnet at half filling per site on the honeycomb lattice, an
explicit construction of such a wavefunction is challenging and cannot
be achieved in a non-interacting system. Recently, Kimchi {\it et al.} constructed
such a wavefunction and demonstrated that it does not break any
symmetries and is not topologically ordered.
Here, we use recently developed tensor network tools to argue that this wavefunction, while
appearing completely featureless in the bulk, is not
adiabatically connected to a non-entangled state. This is achieved by exposing
non-trivial structure in the entanglement spectrum, including a gapless edge
described by a conformal field theory and degeneracies protected by the non-trivial
action of combined charge-conservation and spatial symmetries on the edge.
The phase thus constitutes an interacting, bosonic symmetry-protected phase
protected by lattice symmetries.

%While the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem forbids the existence of fully
%symmetric quantum paramagnetic phases on lattices with fractional
%filling of particles per unit cell, such a phase is in principle
%allowed with certain fractional numbers of particles per site on
%non-Bravais lattices, including half-filling on the honeycomb lattice.
%It has been shown that a non-interacting Hamiltonian of spinless
%fermions or bosons cannot have such a symmetric insulating ground
%state, and an explicit construction using interactions is challenging.
%Recently, Kimchi et al. constructed a wavefunction for bosons at
%half-filling that does not break any symmetries and is not
%topologically ordered--and in this sense is a featureless insulator in
%the bulk. Here, however, we reveal that this wavefunction exhibits
%non-trivial structure at the edge. We apply recently developed
%techniques based on a tensor network representation of the
%wavefunction to demonstrate the presence of a gapless entanglement
%spectrum and a non-trivial action of combined charge-conservation and
%spatial symmetries on the edge. We will also discuss the possibility
%of finding a parent Hamiltonian and analyzing the existence of a
%symmetry-protected topological phase around this state.
