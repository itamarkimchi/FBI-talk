  abstract      = "Within the Landau paradigm, phases of matter are
                   distinguished by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Implicit
                   here is the assumption that a completely symmetric state
                   exists: a paramagnet. At zero temperature such quantum
                   featureless insulators may be forbidden, triggering either
                   conventional order or topological order with fractionalized
                   excitations. Such is the case for interacting particles when
                   the particle number per unit cell, f, is not an integer.
                   But, can lattice symmetries forbid featureless insulators
                   even at integer f? An especially relevant case is the
                   honeycomb (graphene) lattice --- where free spinless
                   fermions at f=1 (the two sites per unit cell mean f=1 is
                   half filling per site) are always metallic. Here we present
                   wave functions for bosons, and a related spin-singlet wave
                   function for spinful electrons, on the f=1 honeycomb, and
                   demonstrate via quantum to classical mappings that they do
                   form featureless Mott insulators. The construction
                   generalizes to symmorphic lattices at integer f in any
                   dimension. Our results explicitly demonstrate that in this
                   case, despite the absence of a non-interacting insulator at
                   the same filling, lack of order at zero temperature does not
                   imply fractionalization.",

  abstract      = "Band insulators appear in a crystalline system only when the
                   filling -- the number of electrons per unit cell and spin
                   projection -- is an integer. At fractional filling, an
                   insulating phase that preserves all symmetries is a Mott
                   insulator, i.e. it is either gapless or, if gapped, displays
                   fractionalized excitations and topological order. We raise
                   the inverse question -- at an integer filling is a band
                   insulator always possible? Here we show that lattice
                   symmetries may forbid a band insulator even at certain
                   integer fillings, if the crystal is non-symmorphic -- a
                   property shared by a majority of three-dimensional crystal
                   structures. In these cases, one may infer the existence of
                   topological order if the ground state is gapped and fully
                   symmetric. This is demonstrated using a non-perturbative
                   flux threading argument, which has immediate applications to
                   quantum spin systems and bosonic insulators in addition to
                   electronic band structures in the absence of spin-orbit
                   interactions.",

                   properties of quantum systems and theories associated to
                   their boundaries have been observed. In this work, we
                   provide an exact duality mapping between the bulk of a
                   quantum spin system and its boundary using Projected
                   Entangled Pair States (PEPS). This duality associates to
                   every region a Hamiltonian on its boundary, in such a way
                   that the entanglement spectrum of the bulk corresponds to
                   the excitation spectrum of the boundary Hamiltonian. We
                   study various specific models, like a deformed AKLT [1], an
                   Ising-type [2], and Kitaev's toric code [3], both in finite
                   ladders and infinite square lattices. In the latter case,
                   some of those models display quantum phase transitions. We
                   find that a gapped bulk phase with local order corresponds
                   to a boundary Hamiltonian with local interactions, whereas
                   critical behavior in the bulk is reflected on a diverging
                   interaction length of the boundary Hamiltonian. Furthermore,
                   topologically ordered states yield non-local Hamiltonians.
                   As our duality also associates a boundary operator to any
                   operator in the bulk, it in fact provides a full holographic
                   framework for the study of quantum many-body systems via
                   their boundary.",
